STEM is fun and exciting. My goal is to be able to contribute to societies which will improve people’s lives and advance the evolving technology by creating efficient tools/machines or designing useful programs/applications.

When I started teaching robotics, programming, and other IoT projects, I realized I enjoyed coding and designing a lot, and I liked to be around with modern and cutting-edge technology. Since then, I can't stop learning new technology, computer languages, and other computer software that I have never tried before. I started taking online courses to not just self-study but also further develop my computer skills which are useful and popular in the current industry or job market.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, troubleshooting, computer-aided designing (CAD), teaching, and client facing. So far I have Python, C#, C++, VB, HTML, CSS, PHP, Java, Git/GitHub, MySQL, and AutoCAD/SolidWorks under my belt. I have started learning Oracle SQL, ASP.Net, React, Redux, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python for interview. I am still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other programming languages such as Apache Spark, Scala, SaaS App with Flask, and AI machine learning with Python and R.
